# ROS-with-Jetson-for-AUVs
We will be learning the basics of Jetson and how to integrate it with Arduino and various sensors like depth sensor, imu etc.
Here we will be working on Jetson Orin Nano with Jetpack 5.1.1 which has Ubuntu 20.04 based root system. The ROS version we will be using is ROS1 - Noetic.
